# Introduction to Ethical Hacking/Pentesting

**Follow these steps to get started:** 1. Install linux on your system. **Kali Linux** recommended. Download `iso` from [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/). 2. Learn basic linux commands. 3. Learn the basics of some programming languages \(`HTML/CSS`, `JS`, `PHP`, `SQL`, `Python`\) For basics and in-short tutorials, watch [Derek's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSX7fVd4OUFp_ODd86H0ZIY)

1. Learn these essential concepts:
   * Methods \(mainly `GET` and `POST` methods\)
   * IP \(**I**nternet **P**rotocol\)
   * DNS \(**D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem\)
   * SSH \(**S**ecure **Sh**ell\)
   * Telnet \(**T**eletype **N**etwork\)
   * Port

### How does the internet work?

* [IP Addresses and the Internet - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bDA5FK6gs)

## Recommended learning

* Learn **Python**, as many tools/scripts are made out of it.
* Learn to use **Github**, as it is like a best friend to any hacker.
* Learn about [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) \(Open Web Application Security Project\) community and its list of [top 10 vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project).
* learn basics of command line editors Vim and GNU nano.
* Learn some frequently used commands: 

  ```bash
  cat, ls, vim, ping, file, find, du, pwd, env, chmod, wget, cron, telnet, gzip, bzip2, tar, base64, grep, nc, curl, strings, whatweb, wildcards and many more...
  ```

## Cyber Security Challenges/Practice

* Solve basic CTF problems from [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) on **OverTheWire**.
* After completing **Bandit** and **Natas**, move on to [Hack this site](https://www.hackthissite.org/)\(contains challenges covering the basics and JS\)
* Start doing challenges from [backdoor by SDSLabs](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co/), try solving previous CTF challenges from [**picoCTF**](https://picoctf.com/).
* Start participating in CTFs on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/). This will boost your problem solving skills.
* Solve previous questions of CTF and read Writeups.

## Branches of Cyber Security:

1. Web security
2. Network security
3. Forensics
4. Application Security
5. Steganography
6. Mobile Pentest,

   and so on..

## Advanced Learning

* Learn creating ssh public key and connecting to ssh server: [pico2017 keyz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CN65ccfllU)
* Master some of the most important tools of Kali: 
  * Burpsuite
  * Webscrab
  * Metasploit
  * Nmap
  * Wireshark
* Learn using some browser extentions helpful in solving CTF problems:
  * Hackbar
  * Cookie-editor
  * Open referer control
* Learn about various vulnerabilities: 

  ```bash
  XSS, Htmli, Sqli, Parameter Tampering, Host Header Injection, URL Redirection, LFI, RFI, CCRF, SSRF, Subdomain Takeover, CMDi, XMLI, etc.
  ```
